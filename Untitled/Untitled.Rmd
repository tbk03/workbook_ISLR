## Questions

-   Is at least one of the predictors useful in predicting the response? *F-statistic.*

-   Do all the predictors help to explain Y, or is it a subset of predictors that help to explain Y? *Compare models with different subsets. Metric include AIC, BIC, adjusted R^2^* and Mallow's $$C_{p}$$.

-   How well does the model fit the data? *RSE and R^2^* *(training data)*

-   Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict? And, how accurate is our prediction? *RSE and R^2^* *(test data)*
